# Parkinson Disease
Parkinson Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and motor control. It is characterized by symptoms like tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement. The exact cause is unknown, but treatment options are available to manage symptoms and improve the quality of life for individuals with Parkinson's disease. Using Machine Learning, we predict PD using vocal features extracted from voice recordings
